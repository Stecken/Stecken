## My History:

I will tell you a little bit about my story, I started in the world of programming in 2019, studying in a technical course in Mechatronics integrated to high school at the Federal Institute of São Paulo, with instruction in pseudo-languages, programming logic and then C language. the fact, i fell in love with technology, and started to study the web part, but developed a high taste for security research and vulnerability research. I studied more C, and started for C++ and C#, producing embedded systems and software for Windows systems, and also studying Assembly in an emphasis on embedded systems, but together with 32x and 64x systems, for possible production of Reverse Engineering.

I intend to continue in the research of vulnerabilities, and in the study of systems modification, and production of embedded systems. In the near future I intend to take C/C++ certifications, and serve as a whitehat for vulnerability researchers.

If possible, I will attend a college in Computer Science, or a mathematical specialization, in specific calculus, which is very important to produce algorithms that solve big problems, and to develop systems with AI.
